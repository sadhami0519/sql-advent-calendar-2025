-- Table Schema:
-- Table: resort_monthly_snowfall
--   resort_id: INT
--   resort_name: VARCHAR
--   snow_month: INT
--   snowfall_inches: DECIMAL
--

-- My Solution:

WITH total_snowfall_in_resorts AS (SELECT
  resort_name,
  SUM(snowfall_inches) AS total_snowfall
FROM resort_monthly_snowfall
GROUP BY resort_name
  ) 

SELECT 
    resort_name, 
    total_snowfall, 
    NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY total_snowfall ASC) AS snowfall_rank
FROM total_snowfall_in_resorts
ORDER BY total_snowfall ASC;
